# Static-Site-Gen-NodeJS
Static Site Generators are a new, hybrid approach to web development that allow you to build a powerful, 
server-based website locally on your computer but pre-builds the site into static files for deployment.

## Tools Used
I used [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) to make my own Static Site Generator. <br>
For a beginner you can refer to my [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/q1YGCh2Ze4w) in which I explained how to create it from the scratch.

## Requirements
For this Project you need the knowledege in the following techs:
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * JS
 * Node.js

## Git Shortcuts
In the video I have made use of my own git aliases, which will not work on your systems.<br>
For building any kind of project like this you can increase your pace by making use of your own shortcuts. In order to create your own shortcuts,
you can refer to my blog [here](https://blog.praveen.science/git-shortcuts/).
